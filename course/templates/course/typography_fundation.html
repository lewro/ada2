      For the purpose of application design, we are only going to
      explain the core foundation of typography.

      Working with letter spacing can increase readability, especially on small text sizes where letters might be too close together by default so you need to adjust the settings.

      There are two types of types: serif and sans serif. A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter.

      Weight of the text is a very useful tool which you should be using often to bring structure to your designs. Weight refers to the relative thickness of a fontâ€™s stroke.

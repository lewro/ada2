      Prototyping is a great tool to mimic the behaviour of the application. Prototyping software allows you to connect two static images the way that you can tap on a predefined area on the first image and show another image.

      A prototype allows your clients to test the user flows the way the application users would but with creation limitations. You canâ€™t enter any text for example.

      There are various tools you can use to create a prototype. Adobe Xd has already prototyping build in but you could also use web apps like Marvelapp or Invision.

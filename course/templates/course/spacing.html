      The golden rule of application design is: Measure everything and keep it consistent.

      Itâ€™s up to you as a designer to choose the spacing but it needs to be consistent across all your design files.

      Once you set the spacing for example between your header and sub-header you should keep it consistent and use the same spacing in all your files.

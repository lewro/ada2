    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>Talk to your client daily. Inform them about your progress. Ask them for feedback. Make them feel they have control over the project. </p>

    <h3>Ego</h3>
    <p>Leave your ego at home. Be nice, polite and do not push your opinions on the client. Try to see it from their side and offer solutions, variations, iterations.</p>

    <h3>Your name is the only thing you have</h3>
    <p>Remember that most of the work is passed by recommendations. Always make a good impression. Be on time. Reach all deadlines and if you canâ€™t overcommunicate.</p>

    <p>Your client is paying for the project and he needs to be happy during the process and after the work has been done. </p>
